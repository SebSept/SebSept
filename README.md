## Hi There :) 

I'm a php developer.  
I'm currently training as a Symfony developper for a few months.  
I worked mostly working around [Prestashop](https://github.com/prestashop).

I'm focused on php (php is great).
I'm curious about all the way it can be used.
I sometimes try other code languages then go back to php with new perspectives.
I like to try new patterns, function, packages, etc.

I love to learn, and I'm focusing on achieving good/excellent code quality.

My current code hobby is this [php starter repo](https://github.com/SebSept/php-starter) which helps getting started with a new Symfony project in a few seconds.

I was an active member of [Friend's Of Presta Console](https://github.com/friends-of-presta/fop_console/) (most active contributor).

You may like [my GitHub's stars](https://github.com/SebSept?tab=stars), then follow me :)
