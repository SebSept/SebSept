## Hi There :) 

I'm a php developer, mostly working around [Prestashop](https://github.com/prestashop) as a freelance.

I'm focused on php (php is great).
I'm curious about all the way it can be used.
I sometimes try other code languages then go back to php with new perspectives.
I like to try new patterns, function, packages, etc.

I love to learn, and I'm focusing on achieving good/excellent code quality.

I'm an active member of [Friend's Of Presta Console](https://github.com/friends-of-presta/fop_console/).
